BuildItBigger

My implementation of the Udacity BuildItBigger project.  This includes all of the following:

- A Java library that provides jokes.  There are five jokes hard coded into the library, of which one is selected at random.
- An adroid library to display the joke.
- A Google Cloud Endpoint, which serves a joke from the Joke library
- Functional and UI tests
- A 'free' version which includes a banner and interstitial ad.  A paid' version which does not include any ads.
- A loading indicator
- A project level task that starts the local GAE server, runs all tests and then shuts down the local GAE server.
